# AlgorithmCompare

This project was developed to illustrate the difference between DFS, BFS and A* algorithms, by allowing the user to create a maze in a grid and observe how every algorithm behaves in order to find its objective.

If you want to run this project you will need to activate the virtual environment by:
* Running `Scripts/Activate.ps1` if you are in PowerShell
* Running `Scripts/activate.bat` if you are in the command prompt (Not tested)
* Running `source Scripts/activate` on linux or Mac (Last one not tested)

Then, just execute any of these commands from root directory:
`python src/main.py`
or
`Scripts/python.exe src/main.py`

To exit the virtual environment you can either close the shell or run the deactivate scripts.
